I designed and made a container for the circuit in IA2 using 3D printing. 

##Information
We have discussed ideas like traffic flow, popular fashion, and productivity. Among them we think productivity is the most interesting and useful information. So we plan to display the amount of poor used time, like time spent on social media.

##Display Methods
At first we wanted to applied uniMorph. But after doing some research we found that the experiment is time and money consumed so we give up this plan and switch to using servo to change the fabric shape.

##Justification
We made a fully-functional fabric display system. We did experiments on the extension level of different fabric and the estimation of servo's torque. We fully achieved our plan that we can rotate a part of the fabric in x-y plane to generate a twist feature and also pull a part of the fabric in z axis to create a valley on the fabric plane. Combined this two operation on fabric shape, we create interesting display according to our data.

##Results
The function of the circuit is as same as in IA2. Users can hold this container and point the sensor to detection direction  and read the output from the top of the container.

##Reflection
The size of the container's joint parts is hard to design because the outputs of 3D printing is a little bit larger than the designed model. Even I left some space at the joint parts, it was still not matched perfectly.
